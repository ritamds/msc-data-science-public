On any given week, teachers and/or parents leverage our product, Mystery Science, to help their children stay curious. Roughly 2 million kids view our content on a weekly basis alone. While we are proud of this accomplishment, we have an ambitious goal of reaching every elementary school student in the country. In short, we are growing quickly and with growth...comes lots of data!

As a Data Scientist at Mystery.org, you will be granted the freedom to use your data analytics and experimentation skills across the organization. You'll join a 4 person Growth team made up of 2 other data scientists, a lead growth engineer, and our Director of Growth. You’ll work cross-functionally to answer our most important questions by innovating and uncovering breakthroughs.

You will report to Huey Kwik, our Director of Growth. We are headquartered in San Francisco and this position is open to both local and remote US-based candidates.

About You
Can you translate questions from non-technical stakeholders into decisions that can be answered with data?
Can you communicate complicated/foreign concepts or methodology to non-experts?
Are you familiar with Python? Numerical & analytical programming (i.e. pandas, scipy, etc)? SQL? Experimentation?
Do you have basic proficiency in statistics and statistical modeling?
Do you have experience, knowledge or interest in one or more of the following areas: Practical A/B testing for websites, feature engineering, predictive modeling (including using models in production), familiarity with machine learning algorithms?
About Mystery.org

At Mystery.org, we believe it’s important that children stay curious as they grow up. We will ensure that the next generation sees it’s an amazing world we live in, full of possibility and wonder — and that they learn how to figure things out for themselves.

We’re doing this by building the missing internet for children. Our first tool was created for children to use in the classroom. We have teachers signed up from 89% of elementary schools in the U.S. and now 50% of schools use us every month. We’ve created one of the fastest-growing learning resources and a brand that is loved by children. Now, we’re developing a new version of our product for parents and children to use at home.

For three years running, our sales have doubled. We’ve exceeded $10M in annual recurring revenue and are growing quickly.

When we talk about “the missing internet for children,” we intend to give children an experience that grownups take for granted: the ability to instantly explore anything they wonder about. Most adults don't realize how inaccessible knowledge is to children. For their first ten years of life, any time a child wonders something all they can do is ask grownups: parents at home and teachers at school. There are 1 billion children in the world today, and we’re making it possible for them to explore their questions, wherever they are. Over the past decade, grownups have been given this superpower but children have been left behind. So we're collecting every question children ask and creating video explanations for all of them. We think this will be the most important learning tool ever created.

Meet The Team

On your first day at Mystery.org, you’ll meet a group of 50 people who are passionate about learning and who each love their respective crafts. Our co-founder, Doug Peltz, began by assembling a team of the best explainers in the world from the Exploratorium, Klutz, Stanford, the Field Museum, and leading private schools. Our CEO, Keith Schacht, followed this by building a team of strong product engineers and designers. Keith was previously at Facebook as the product manager for News Feed and Messenger.

We have a strong focus on people that extends to every area of the company. We’re building the team that we want to work with.

The team at Mystery.org believes in the power of diversity and we hope you do too! We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and encourage members of underrepresented communities to apply.

The Analytics Team of the National ACLU Digital, Tech & Analytics Department has openings for undergraduate or graduate internships in New York, NY.
ACLU Analytics partners with teams across the organization to enable the ACLU to make smart, evidence-based decisions and bring quantitative insights on our issues to the courtroom and the public. Our team's work ranges from social science research for litigation & advocacy, to analysis & reporting for fundraising and engagement, to building and maintaining our data infrastructure. We strive to ensure the ACLU leads by example in the ethical use of data and technology. This includes maintaining our privacy and security standards, pushing for transparent data practices from government and corporate actors, and helping to steward high standards for algorithmic fairness, accountability, and transparency.

For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has been our nation's guardian of liberty, working in courts, legislatures, and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States. Whether it's ending mass incarceration, achieving full equality for the LGBT community, advancing racial justice, establishing new privacy protections for our digital age, or preserving the right to vote or the right to have an abortion, the ACLU takes up the toughest civil liberties and civil rights cases and issues to defend all people from government abuse and overreach. With more than one million members, activists, and supporters, the ACLU is a nationwide organization that fights tirelessly in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., for the principle that every individual's rights must be protected equally under the law, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, national origin, and record of arrest or conviction.

Plan ways to collaborate with other types of technologies, tools, alongside graph to make more powerful solutions in data science.
Work with industry partners / Neo4j users / companies / thought-leaders to help align their graph data science stories with trending topics and push their message to the data science community (advice or sharing opportunities that you discover for awareness).
Present at industry conferences.
The leading Graph Database Neo4j is extending its capabilities in the data science space with additional functionality for graph data science. Data scientists should be enabled to use contextual connected data to make better predictions and improve the accuracy of their models.

We hope you will consider joining our team! ALL human beings are welcome, and we are committed to helping you thrive here. We believe our team, as well as the outdoors, is for everyone.
Primary responsibilities:
Design, develop, test, and deploy data science solutions for our software on your own or in collaboration with other developers
Review the code of other developers on your team
Work with product owners and designers on your team to create workable solutions

Software developers at Campspot work on small agile teams to build our products. Campspot developers are truly full stack, working on both front and back end code, as well as managing the whole lifecycle of a feature from planning through delivery.
Campspot is built on a modern tech stack using the latest versions of Java and Kotlin on our backend with the Dropwizard framework, and TypeScript on our frontend using Angular. Our products are SAAS applications that run on AWS cloud infrastructure and we use modern tools like Terraform to manage that. We believe that skilled developers can be successful in any tech stack and set our expectations for ramp up time accordingly, but having experience in any of the technology above is a big plus.
Development at Campspot is heavy on collaboration. Developers are expected to collaborate with each other via technical design meetings, pair programming, and code reviews. Developers also collaborate directly with our product owners to scope, refine, and test features. Lastly, developers need to collaborate with our designers to create solid UX for new features in our app.
Automated testing is another key skill for developers at Campspot. All new code coming into our application is expected to have unit and integration tests written for it. We utilize automated CI builds to constantly make sure that our app builds correctly and all of our tests pass.
Key skills for this role:
1+ years of experience with web application development
Experience identifying and solving software bugs
Excitement for learning new technologies
Solid communication - receiving and giving feedback on code and architecture, ability to talk through ideas and approach
Collaboration, including sometimes doing pair programming with other developers

Things that will help you stand out for this role:
Experience with Java, Kotlin, or TypeScript
Experience with AWS or other cloud infrastructure
Experience in an environment that does TDD or pair programming
Experience with Javascript data visualization libraries
Experience with statistical programming in R or Python

Campspot is not currently sponsoring H1B Visas.

156,698cf13f5aa067fa,"Data Scientist, Product",Splice.com,New York State,"[About the Role

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Data and Insights team. In this role, you will define metrics used to track engagement, feature usage, and user-centric outcomes. You will use data to uncover user preferences and quantify product experiences, all with an aim of guiding our Search and Recommendations team to build more relevant and impactful experiences for our users.

All of this means balancing ad hoc data exploration and longer-running analytical projects; designing and conducting experiments; bridging the gap between Product Managers and Data Engineers to assure that the necessary data is accessible and easy to use; regularly presenting findings to the Data and Insights team, Search and Recommendations team, as well as the company.

Skills we're looking for
Data manipulation

In our opinion, things that can be reasonably expressed in SQL, ought to be. We expect our Data Scientists to have strong analytical SQL skills. This means a fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions. This role will work with large-scale data, so this person must have experience writing efficient, performance-optimized queries.

Analysis

Right now, our bias is toward models that can be interpreted to drive human action. We're seeking an individual who enjoys experimentation and statistical analysis—someone who can translate what they see in the data into useful policy suggestions. A thorough understanding of statistical inference is required.

Modeling

You should have hands-on experience building machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised) and know how to incorporate your models into production workflows and product experiences. At the outset, this role will largely focus on experimentation and more foundational product analysis; however, some degree of specialization in either preference learning and recommendations or text processing and search is expected.

Tooling expectations
Regular usage of a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (ideally Python).
Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, or a similar MPP data-warehouse technology).
Hands-on experience with self-service product-analytics tools (e.g., Looker, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap).
Training in statistics, econometrics, or machine learning, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies.
Exposure to data sets used by Product teams. Chiefly, large-scale event data (e.g., Mixpanel, Segment, Snowplow, server logs) and normalized transactional databases (e.g., e-commerce and subscription datasets).
Additional comments

There are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.

As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is an asset. If this topic is new to you, that's okay—you should be open to learning about it.

New York Life, the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Delivery Design leader in its Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (CDSAi).
The company has 175 years of history and while usable data does not quite go back that far, we have a wealth of internal information on consumers, policies and their performance, as well as applicants, prospects and our 12,000 agents. We also have a multitude of external data from a great variety of sources. New York Life is likely the most data-rich company in the life insurance industry. Analytical challenges range from mortality risk to agent recruiting decisions, service optimization, consumer analytics (segmentation, response, conversion, retention, up-sell), fraud detection, advertising allocation and digital advertising optimization.
The Center for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (CDSAi) is the innovative corporate Analytics group within New York Life. We are a rapidly growing entrepreneurial department which aims to design, create and offer innovative data-driven solutions for many parts of the enterprise. We are aided by New York Life’s existing business with a large market share in individual life insurance. We have the freedom to explore external data sources and new statistical techniques, and are excited about delivering a whole new generation of predictive analytics and artificial intelligence solutions.
In fact, we are building one of the first multivariate model-based continuous risk differentiations in the industry. We are also working on models for differentiated advertising allocation by geography, channel and segment. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics. Our products are implemented into real-time core business processes and decisions that drive the company (e.g. underwriting, pricing, agent recruiting, prospecting, advertising allocation, new product development).
We work with data ranging from demographics, credit and geo data to detailed medical data (medical test results, diagnosis, prescriptions) and social media information. We have a modern computing environment with a solid suite of data science/modeling tools and packages, and a large (but manageable) group of well-trained professionals at various levels to support you. Life insurance is on the verge of huge change. This is a chance to drive the transformation of an industry. Is this not why we became data scientists?

You will apply your highly developed technical predictive analytics skills to deeply understand and interact with our solutions for the priority projects, and then derive creative means to present them in highly engaging visual and interactive ways to the non-technical stakeholders, while still accurately representing the core ideas.
You will apply your consulting experience, empathy and comprehension of various business areas (and over time their leaders) to connect our work to their interests and mindsets.
You will apply (for certain projects and events) your creativity and artistic ability to design and build appealing displays and interactive objects (digital or physical).

Pinterest brings millions of people the inspiration to create a life they love. To evolve this mission our product and engineering teams need to innovate. The key to understanding how innovation on the product will change our business is through measurement, and the faster we can evaluate these ideas, the faster we can innovate. Experimentation is at the core of this evaluation - and both implicit (obtaining feedback from pinners through their engagement with changes) and explicit (obtaining labels from human evaluators or Pinners on questions about the content or change) signals can be used to evaluate the success of the idea.

Teams within Pinterest run thousands of such experiments each year, but there is a substantial opportunity to improve the value derived from each experiment and the speed at which we unlock this value; impact in this space transforms both the productivity of our teams and the speed of innovation at the company. We are looking for a highly technical Data Scientist who is passionate about driving innovation to join a small team of data scientists to shape and evolve our experimentation tooling and our culture of experimentation.

What you’ll do:

Solve key challenges in the experimentation space - from increasing the sensitivity of measurement - to developing techniques that shed insight into why an experiment did not perform as expected - to shaping the metrics we use to measure the value a new product innovation will provide to Pinners or advertisers
Collaborate with data scientists, engineers and product partners to build and evolve the tools that enable us to evaluate and interpret experimental data at scale
Understand our opportunity for improvement by analyzing data across thousands of past experiments to identify patterns and insights that determine the problems we tackle next
Shape and evolve the culture of experimentation across the company through a well-articulated understanding of the limitations in place today and the value that will be derived from change

What we’re looking for:

Advanced degree in a quantitative field with 4+ years of industry experience and a proven track record of applying statistical methods to solve real-world problems using big data
Experience working with experimentation, measurement or human evaluation platforms and a past experience related to the evolution of these platforms
Track record of influencing others through data
Demonstrated execution and impact on initiatives that cross multiple product areas and interface with leadership and product teams
Self-propelled continuous learner who keeps up with new tools and methodologies and builds prototypes with concepts learned
Expertise in at least one scripting language (ideally Python/R)

258,340a5140d36eebaa,Data Scientist,O'Reilly Media,Remote,"[About O'Reilly Media

O’Reilly’s mission is “changing the world by sharing the knowledge of innovators.” For the last 40 years, we’ve been helping people learn new skills, track significant new technologies, and build careers in technology and business. This extends to our employees: we have a long and proud history of encouraging and enabling the people who work here to take advantage of O’Reilly’s resources and network to keep learning, take on new challenges, and build careers. O’Reilly Media has two main offices, in Boston and Sebastopol (San Francisco Bay Area), with a large portion of our employees working remotely.

About your team

Data drives much of what we at O’Reilly Media do, making the Data Science Team central to how the company operates and continues to grow its influence. We provide business analysis and reporting, build machine learning models, develop prototypes for data-intensive components to the platform, and maintain data systems. We are a distributed team working remotely from home offices, but we place a strong emphasis on teamwork and collaboration: an ideal candidate is one that is both self-motivated and enjoys working with others. Team members are encouraged to learn new skills and technologies as they relate to our mission. We believe work should be fun and friendly, and we hold dear our core belief in maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

About the Job

We have an opening for a Data Scientist who will perform a variety of analyses and data tasks to support core business capabilities such as marketing, sales and product improvements.

Both quantitative and qualitative aspects of analysis are important to this role. The Data Scientist’s primary responsibilities include pulling, cleaning, transforming and analyzing both internal and external data, as well as performing more advanced modeling and machine learning tasks. Some of our projects are based on requests from other departments, others are driven by larger data science team goals. Often we are asked to look into fairly open-ended problems, which requires a degree of creativity, curiosity and research skill.

Crucial to this role is seeing the bigger picture: not just following the instructions of a JIRA ticket or request, but realizing the implications and actionable potential of an analysis. The Data Scientist must understand what data we have – or need to obtain – in order to provide significant insights and value to our learning customers and internal organization. This demands creativity and drive to figure out how to get the data, and how to use the data to keep O’Reilly at the forefront of learning.

The Data Scientist works on problems that are core to the company’s mission. Our team is at the forefront of some of the business’s major challenges, for example, understanding and modeling how users progress through content and developing metrics that describe their learning experience. This role has a significant opportunity to positively impact the company through data-driven means.

Most of our analysis is performed in Python and SQL. Our primary data storage systems are based on Postgres, Redshift, MySQL, BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage. The Data Scientist will:

Extract, transform and analyze platform and customer data based on requests from product, sales, marketing and executive teams
Write code to automate processes for routine data reporting requirements
Undertake research to explore more open-ended data problems
Effectively present and communicate research results with coherent visualization and actionable recommendations
Work with product teams on platform features such as user-facing dashboards, personalization, topic organization, search and content discovery
Maintain our backend data ETL processes and automated reporting services
Drive the Data Science Team’s impact in the company by taking the initiative with data-driven solutions for company problems

About You

You should have a strong foundation in Python programming for data-related tasks, including experience with data science packages such as numpy and scikit-learn, and strong SQL skills. The level of coding required will go beyond simple scripts and queries: we are always trying to automate the boring stuff with well-designed and efficiently engineered packages of code. Some knowledge of git, unix commands and big data / distributing computing solutions is highly valued.

Key skills and Experience
2+ years in data science / analytics, or equivalent
Excellent Python skills
Strong SQL skills
Personable and able to work with with others in a team
Significant experience combining and transforming data
Experience with wrangling dirty data
Excellent critical thinking skills and the ability to develop creative solutions to challenging problems

We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it.

Examples of some projects our data scientists have worked on include modeling our long-term growth, improving the relevance and personalization of the homepage feed, and exploratory analysis of factors driving question-asking behavior. For more about our work, see Quora's Data blog at https://data.quora.com/.

As a senior data scientist, you will draw on your experience to excel not only in your own work but also to elevate data's impact at a company-wide level. You will provide team mentorship that propels the work of your colleagues while helping to establish best practices for data usage across Quora.

Extract actionable insights from broad, open-ended questions
Design and evaluate experiments to measure the impact of product changes

Project Overview:

The current COVID-19 pandemic exceeds the existing Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Local Boards of Health ability to perform contact tracing. As a result, many people are unaware that they are a contact of a person with COVID-19. Contacts may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 and can unwittingly spread the virus in the community. To break the chain of transmission, contact tracing and isolation must be scaled-up rapidly.

To support the Department of Public Health (DPH), Partners In Health (PIH) will hire, train and supervise a large team of community contact tracing staff across Massachusetts. The aim of this will be to call every person diagnosed with COVID-19, gather their contacts, and proceed to call every contact in Massachusetts. In tandem with Commonwealth-wide effort to increase testing and improving communication and implementation of isolation and quarantine this will fortify efforts to control the pandemic in Massachusetts.

The contract tracing staff consists of several roles, including contact tracers, case investigators, care resource coordinators, local health liaisons and outbreak investigators. This large team will use an online platform (Salesforce) to support data flow, data collection and entry, and to coordinate the workflows involved for contact tracing.

Project Overview:

The current COVID-19 pandemic exceeds the existing Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Local Boards of Health ability to perform contact tracing. As a result, many people are unaware that they are a contact of a person with COVID-19. Contacts may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 and can unwittingly spread the virus in the community. To break the chain of transmission, contact tracing and isolation must be scaled-up rapidly.

To support the Department of Public Health (DPH), Partners In Health (PIH) will hire, train and supervise a large team of community contact tracing staff across Massachusetts. The aim of this will be to call every person diagnosed with COVID-19, gather their contacts, and proceed to call every contact in Massachusetts. In tandem with Commonwealth-wide effort to increase testing and improving communication and implementation of isolation and quarantine this will fortify efforts to control the pandemic in Massachusetts.

The contract tracing staff consists of several roles, including contact tracers, case investigators, care resource coordinators, local health liaisons and outbreak investigators. This large team will use an online platform (Salesforce) to support data flow, data collection and entry, and to coordinate the workflows involved for contact tracing. The project will also employ a data team to oversee the overall impact of the project, monitor metrics and adjust project strategy in real time, and liaise with other partners and stakeholders in the data flow such as testing centers.

Project Overview:

The current COVID-19 pandemic exceeds the existing Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Local Boards of Health ability to perform contact tracing. As a result, many people are unaware that they are a contact of a person with COVID-19. Contacts may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 and can unwittingly spread the virus in the community. To break the chain of transmission, contact tracing and isolation must be scaled-up rapidly.

To support the Department of Public Health (DPH), Partners In Health (PIH) will hire, train and supervise a large team of community contact tracing staff across Massachusetts. The aim of this will be to call every person diagnosed with COVID-19, gather their contacts, and proceed to call every contact in Massachusetts. In tandem with Commonwealth-wide effort to increase testing and improving communication and implementation of isolation and quarantine this will fortify efforts to control the pandemic in Massachusetts.

The contract tracing staff consists of several roles, including contact tracers, case investigators, care resource coordinators, local health liaisons and outbreak investigators. This large team will use an online platform (Salesforce) to support data flow, data collection and entry, and to coordinate the workflows involved for contact tracing.

Reports to: EIU Manager
Location: Massachusetts (Remote)
Position Type: Full-time, may include evenings and weekends

Project Overview:

The current COVID-19 pandemic exceeds the existing Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Local Boards of Health ability to perform contact tracing. As a result, many people are unaware that they are a contact of a person with COVID-19. Contacts may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 and can unwittingly spread the virus in the community. To break the chain of transmission, contact tracing and isolation must be scaled-up rapidly.

To support the Department of Public Health (DPH), Partners In Health (PIH) will hire, train and supervise a large team of community contact tracing staff across Massachusetts. The aim of this will be to call every person diagnosed with COVID-19, gather their contacts, and proceed to call every contact in Massachusetts. In tandem with Commonwealth-wide effort to increase testing and improving communication and implementation of isolation and quarantine this will fortify efforts to control the pandemic in Massachusetts.

The current COVID-19 pandemic exceeds the existing Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Local Boards of Health ability to perform contact tracing. As a result, many people are unaware that they are a contact of a person with COVID-19. Contacts may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 and can unwittingly spread the virus in the community. To break the chain of transmission, contact tracing and isolation must be scaled-up rapidly.

To support the Department of Public Health (DPH), Partners In Health (PIH) will hire, train and supervise a large team of community contact tracing staff across Massachusetts. The aim of this will be to call every person diagnosed with COVID-19, gather their contacts, and proceed to call every contact in Massachusetts. In tandem with Commonwealth-wide effort to increase testing and improving communication and implementation of isolation and quarantine this will fortify efforts to control the pandemic in Massachusetts.

The contract tracing staff consists of several roles, including contact tracers, case investigators, care resource coordinators, local health liaisons and outbreak investigators. This large team will use an online platform (Salesforce) to support data flow, data collection and entry, and to coordinate the workflows involved for contact tracing.

Reports to: EIU Manager
Location: Massachusetts (Remote)
Position Type: Full-time, may include evenings and weekends

Project Overview:

The current COVID-19 pandemic exceeds the existing Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Local Boards of Health ability to perform contact tracing. As a result, many people are unaware that they are a contact of a person with COVID-19. Contacts may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 and can unwittingly spread the virus in the community. To break the chain of transmission, contact tracing and isolation must be scaled-up rapidly.

To support the Department of Public Health (DPH), Partners In Health (PIH) will hire, train and supervise a large team of community contact tracing staff across Massachusetts. The aim of this will be to call every person diagnosed with COVID-19, gather their contacts, and proceed to call every contact in Massachusetts. In tandem with Commonwealth-wide effort to increase testing and improving communication and implementation of isolation and quarantine this will fortify efforts to control the pandemic in Massachusetts.

The contract tracing staff consists of several roles, including contact tracers, case investigators, care resource coordinators, local health liaisons and outbreak investigators. This large team will use an online platform (Salesforce) to support data flow, data collection and entry, and to coordinate the workflows involved for contact tracing. The project will also employ a data team to oversee the overall impact of the project, monitor metrics and adjust project strategy in real time, and liaise with other partners and stakeholders in the data flow such as testing centers.

Position Overview

The EIU Data Analyst will join a fast paced and dynamic Epidemic Intelligence Unit (EIU) to help spearhead contact tracing for COVID-19 in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts specific to clusters both related and unrelated to institutes of higher education. EIU Data Analysts will reside on a specialized team dedicated to cluster management under the Data Team. They will perform data analyses relevant to supporting cluster investigations and other data-related tasks.

Project Overview:

The current COVID-19 pandemic exceeds the existing Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Local Boards of Health ability to perform contact tracing. As a result, many people are unaware that they are a contact of a person with COVID-19. Contacts may have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic COVID-19 and can unwittingly spread the virus in the community. To break the chain of transmission, contact tracing and isolation must be scaled-up rapidly.

To support the Department of Public Health (DPH), Partners In Health (PIH) will hire, train and supervise a large team of community contact tracing staff across Massachusetts. The aim of this will be to call every person diagnosed with COVID-19, gather their contacts, and proceed to call every contact in Massachusetts. In tandem with Commonwealth-wide effort to increase testing and improving communication and implementation of isolation and quarantine this will fortify efforts to control the pandemic in Massachusetts.

The contract tracing staff consists of several roles, including contact tracers, case investigators, care resource coordinators, local health liaisons and outbreak investigators. This large team will use an online platform (Salesforce) to support data flow, data collection and entry, and to coordinate the workflows involved for contact tracing.

To support the Department of Public Health (DPH), Partners In Health (PIH) will hire, train and supervise a large team of community contact tracing staff across Massachusetts. The aim of this will be to call every person diagnosed with COVID-19, gather their contacts, and proceed to call every contact in Massachusetts. In tandem with Commonwealth-wide effort to increase testing and improving communication and implementation of isolation and quarantine this will fortify efforts to control the pandemic in Massachusetts.

The contract tracing staff consists of several roles, including contact tracers, case investigators, care resource coordinators, local health liaisons and outbreak investigators. This large team will use an online platform (Salesforce) to support data flow, data collection and entry, and to coordinate the workflows involved for contact tracing.
